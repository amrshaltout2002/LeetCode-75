# ðŸ§© LeetCode 75 â€” Problem Solving Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the **LeetCode 75 problems**.  
The goal of this repo is to practice problem solving, strengthen my algorithmic thinking, and track my progress as I work through one of the most popular curated problem lists on LeetCode.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

- Practice and improve my problem-solving skills in coding
- Build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures
- Keep my solutions organized in one place
- Share my answers so they might help others who are also working through LeetCode 75

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each solution is stored in its own file, usually named after the problem.  
Solutions are written in Python (for now), but I might add other languages in the future.
